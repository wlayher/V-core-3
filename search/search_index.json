Order Now! This kit is the culmination of Rat Rig's accumulated years of experience designing, producing and distributing DIY 3D Printer kits worldwide. Originally introduced in 2017, the V-Core went through several iterations and multiple variants over time, through a process of continuously seeking user feedback to drive product development. The lessons learned over the years allowed us to understand what works and what doesn't, what features are most valued by users, and what choices ensure both quality and affordability. We've distilled all this knowledge into the V-Core 3, which was designed in partnership with Pawel Kucmus, a long time member of our on-line community and one of the most prolific contributors to the V-Core platform. Order Now! Precision \u00b6 3 Point Kinematic Bed Bed plates expand as they heat up. If their mounting points are unmovable, the bed will have no room to expand to the sides, and it will be forced to bow (either upwards or downwards). The V-Core 3 bed plate is not rigidly connected to the machine's frame. Instead, 3 steel balls connected to the bed sit on low friction dowel pins. The pins act like a pair of rails for the steel balls, guiding their movement as the bed expands and ensuring that only radial movement is possible - there's zero margin for lateral movement. This means that while your plate is firmly in place, it can still remain perfectly flat as it expands. Since the bed only has 3 mounting points, which are connected to 3 independently driven Z motors, bed-levelling is exclusively determined by motor position and can be done 100% electronically - simple and instantaneous. 6mm Cast Tooling Plate for Print bed Immaculate CoreXY Belt Path All movement guided by MGN12 Linear Rails Doubled Z resolution with TR8x4 Lead Screws instead of TR8x8 The V-Core 3 uses 3 lead screws to drive the Z axis of the machine. They move the bed down in small increments, at the end of each complete layer. The Z axis moves very slowly, so speed is not the priority - precision and resolution are. The V-Core 3 uses TR8X4mm lead screws instead of the TR8x8mm used in previous machines, effectively halving the pitch of the lead screw - this means that each rotation of the motor, now moves the bed half as much. This both doubles the Z resolution of your layers and multiplies the holding torque - always helpful when you're moving such a heavy bed, especially on the larger variants. Robustness \u00b6 While previous V-Core versions, like many other printers on the market, relied solely on 20 Series profiles, the V-Core 3 is fully built on a 30 Series aluminium frame. From screws and nuts to brackets and plates, everything is bigger, stronger and tougher. Frame made with 30x30mm T-Slot aluminium with a beautiful black anodization 4mm thick anodized aluminium plates 9mm Belts Weight of Z drivetrain and bed is distributed across the Z motor mounts - not on the motors themselves Customization \u00b6 Available both as a complete kit and a configurable kit (for those who want to select their own electronics) Configurable options include LDO motors, Keenovo Heatpads, and multiple controller board options (from Duet3D, SKR, etc) 3 build volumes available as standard option: 300, 400 and 500 mm3 V-Core 3 variant Build Volume (mm) External dimensions (mm)* 300 300x300x300 518x583x560 400 400x400x400 618x683x660 500 500x500x500 718x783x760 *Z height corresponds to frame height. Your extruder head will protrude slightly above the frame, and you will need extra Z room for filament feed. For the frame version with a top chamber, add 245mm to the given Z height. Full End Stop solutions EVA 2 Carriage System provides mounts for most popular extruder and hot end choices on the market (Bowden, BMG, Titan, Aero, Hemera, and more to come!) Shipping with EVA 2.3.0 (since June 1 st 2021) What is EVA? EVA is an independently developed and maintained project that aims to be a single platform for many extrusion types. Copperhead and Bondtech LGX support incoming! Note that not all print head types (due to their physical dimensions) can achieve the full 300x300 print space. EVA 2 is the next iteration of the EVA platform with which V-Core 3 is fully compatible. Most vivid improvements since the last iteration is the improved front belt clamp feature (no more zip ties!), improved contribution system, more ease of assembly, modular X endstop system, dedicated cable paths and shrouds (for ascetics).

Safety \u00b6 Wiring design includes multiple cable management parts, for cable clamping, guiding and strain relief Custom Keenovo Heat Pad with pre-wired 157\u00baC Thermal Fuse for extra safety (Optional). The wiring comes out of the pad slightly off-center, so it's neatly guided to the back of the machine without interfering with the bed mounting point at the back. For 220V Heat pad users, grounding point at the bed and fully isolated bed from the rest of the printer means that the printer frame is never conducting any dangerous voltages. Convenience \u00b6 Designed for a far easier and quicker assembly than previous versions Separate chamber for electronics ensures heat insulation, short motor cable path, easy access to all wiring, and a very clean installation. *Panel for mounting electronics is not supplied, user is meant to source it locally.

Some ideas have drawn considerable attention and interest, and we're very fortunate as a community that their creators are openly sharing their designs, for everyone to use. In the true spirit of the open-source movement, the hive mind has already taken hold of the project and started the never-ending process of continuous improvement - nothing could make us more excited than witnessing this! Below we offer a tutorial for users to submit their contributions so they can be reviewed by our team and added directly to the main V-Core 3 Repository, on GitHub. We invite all existing and future contributors to use this process, so we can have everything in the same place, for everyone's benefit! Thank you to all contributors for inspiring the community!

If you sourced your motors elsewhere, you need to identify their pinout to avoid damage to the board. You can identify the motor pinout using either a LED diode or a piece of wire. Short two pins like on the example below and then rotate the shaft by hand. When shorting a phase the LED will light up or - if you\u2019re using the wire method - rotating the shaft will become much harder. A very detailed article on the matter is provided in Duet 3D's documentation . Duet 3 Mini 5+ with Duet 3 Expansion Mini 2+ \u00b6 V-Core 3 runs on 6 drives which means a board able to handle 6 or more drives is required.

Introduction \u00b6 V-CoreOS is a preconfigured software package for the V-Core 3, that aims to make it as painless as possible to get Klipper, Fluidd and Moonraker up and running on your printer. It is developed and maintained by Mikkel Schmidt (miklschmidt#2036 on Discord). To run V-CoreOS on your V-Core 3 you need an SKR Pro 1.2 (Other boards coming in the future) and a Raspberry Pi. The initial configuration is made to work with the official SKR Pro 1.2 Wiring Diagram . Download V-CoreOS Preparing the Raspberry Pi \u00b6 Download the newest release (includes a firmware.bin and a vcoreos-*.zip file under the assets dropdown) of VCoreOS on github . Then follow The offical raspberry pi guide to write that image to the SD card that goes into your raspberry pi (8GB or larger) Note: this will destroy all data on the card! WIFI (Optional) Warning Do NOT use a textprocessor such as Wordpad, it will mangle the file and your pi won't boot. Notepad, Notepad++, VSCode are all fine. When the process is complete, find the /boot volume / folder on the sd card. If you're having trouble finding the boot volume, try reinserting the SD card into your PC. Edit the vcoreos-wpa-supplicant.txt file found on the boot volume in a text editor and fill out your wifi information. Note the country code at the bottom of the file. When that is done reinsert the SD card into the Raspberry Pi, but don't turn on your printer / Raspberry Pi just yet. Preparing the SKR Pro \u00b6 Move the firmware.bin file that you downloaded in the previous step to the SD card that goes into your SKR Pro, and reinsert the SD card in to the SKR Pro. Setup \u00b6 With SKR Pro 1.2 connected via USB to your Raspberry Pi, turn on your printer. After a minute or two, open your browser and navigate to http://vcoreos.local/ Configuration In the settings page in Fluidd, there's a list of files, among them should be a printer.cfg . Right click that and choose \"Edit\". This is where your klipper configuration lives. As you can see, it's prepopulated with some included files which are meant to get you up and running quick and easy. Follow the instructions in the file to make sure the configuration matches your setup. Updating In the settings page in Fluidd, you'll see a sheet with the title \"Update Manager\", if you're familiar with Fluidd or Mainsail, you'll notice a new entry called vcore3 . This vcore3 package will update all the config files in the v-core-3 folder, improvements, support for hotends, extruders etc, will be coming to your printer this way in the future. Finalizing \u00b6 You'll need to adjust your endstop and probe z-offset before printing and be sure to run PID tuning for your extruder and your bed. After that it's advisable to run Pressure Advance tuning , Input Shaper calibration and Skew Correction . An easy way to do probe z-offset calibration is to home the printer, then put a piece of paper underneath. Now babystep Z through the Fluidd interface (or by issuing G0 commands through the console) until the nozzle touches the paper and there's a tiny bit of resistance when you pull on it. Then write \"GET_POSITION\" in the console and find the line that says // kinematic: ... And use the Z coordinate from that line, multiplied by -1. So if it says // kinematic: X:0.000000 Y:0.000000 Z:-0.400000 Your probe's z_offset will be 0.4. Troubleshooting \u00b6 If klipper won't connect, try restarting your raspberry pi. Make sure the SKR Pro is connected to the Pi via USB, that both are powered, and that the firmware.bin has been properly flashed. You can verify the last part by checking if the firmware.bin file has been changed to firmware.CUR on the SD card. If you have trouble flashing the motherboard (a green light should flash while booting, indicating the firmware has been flashed succefully), try disconnecting your endstops, if these are wired incorrectly the board will not boot properly. If any of your axes are inverted, tripple check your wiring. It's important to note that this config is made specifically for the SKR Pro 1.2 and the 48mm LDO's that ship optionally with the V-Core 3. For other steppers, you'll have to check the stepper pinout and potentially move pins on your cable, or you can override the stepper dir_pins as needed in your printer.cfg after the steppers.cfg file has been included, like so: [stepper_x] dir_pin: PF1 For further support check out the v-coreos and klipper channels on the Unnofficial RatRig Discord Community . (Optional) Input Shaping using an ADXL345 \u00b6 If you want to use an ADXL345 for automatic input shaper calibration, all the software you need is already installed on the pi, you just need to wire and map the pins for your ADXL345, and you're good to go. A default config and wiring diagram will be included in the future for connecting the ADXL directly to the SKR Pro. Read more here: https://www.klipper3d.org/Measuring_Resonances.html . Software Credits \u00b6 V-CoreOS is based on Klipper , Fluidd , MainsailOS and FluiddPi , without these and the amazing people behind them, V-CoreOS would not have been possible.","title":"Firmware"},{"location":"firmware/#duet-reprap-firmware","text":"This guide was prepared against the RepRap Firmware version 3.2.2 .

Developed on top of the v1.2 build, this version completely redesigns the Z axis of the machine to incorporate the 3 point kinematic bed feature which we introduced in the V-Core 3 . v1.3 is available as an upgrade kit from v1.1 and v1.2, which you can buy here . User Testimonials \u00b6 The new v1.3 comes with the most precise Z drive mechanism I ever found in a 3D printer. After one trim operation, the bed squareness is below 0.02mm on a 300x300 bed. It doesn't get better than that! Simple and clear: it is a huge improvement for the Z axis. The old concept with two rails on the sides never glided as smoothly as the new one - there was always a bit of friction in the rails which caused noise. I didn\u2018t know any better and thought it was standard for a machine with 3 z motors, and I was a bit skeptic about the new design. Now, after one month of operation, I know better. The new Z drive is smoother. It runs so silent I can be in the printer-room and don\u2018t notice the moving bed. Detlev Rackow Much easier to assemble and get right. Much better bed support, especially on large beds. I went from a 1.4mm height variance to just 0.3mm on the 1.3 on my 500mm bed! That's just INSANE! I would highly recommend this upgrade to everyone! Mikkel Schmidt Precision \u00b6 3 Point Kinematic Bed All movement guided by MGN15 Linear Rails Robustness \u00b6 Frame made with 2020 and 2040 V-Slot aluminium with a beautiful black anodization 3mm thick anodized aluminium plates 9mm Belts Weight of Z drivetrain and bed is distributed across the Z motor mounts - not on the motors themselves EVA \u00b6 The EVA Carriage System provides mounts for most popular extruder and hot end choices on the market (Bowden, BMG, Titan, Aero, Hemera, and more to come!)

Note that not all print head types (due to their physical dimensions) can achieve the full 300x300 print space. EVA 2 is the next iteration of the EVA platform with which V-Core Pro is fully compatible. Most vivid improvements since the last iteration is the improved front belt clamp feature (no more zip ties!), improved contribution system, more ease of assembly, modular X endstop system, dedicated cable paths and shrouds (for ascetics).
